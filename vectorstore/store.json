    "Beloved of My Heart\nTalks given from 3/5/76 to 28/5/76\nDarshan Diary\nCHAPTER 1\nThe Other is never Responsible\n3 May 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium\n[A sannyasin mother says she is having problems in her relationship: I find myself being very bitchy\nand nagging sometimes. I feel I’m just asking for a fight all the time.]\nMm mm, love always brings trouble – and it has to be faced. Love cannot be always smooth, and it\nis good that it is not always smooth, otherwise you would not grow.\nWhenever there is a change, any sort of change, things will come into focus more clearly. When\nchange disturbs you, all your inner disturbances are stirred. You are both feeling disturbed and both\ntrying to throw the responsibility on the other. Just try to see it inside yourself. The other is never\nresponsible",
    "ou, all your inner disturbances are stirred. You are both feeling disturbed and both\ntrying to throw the responsibility on the other. Just try to see it inside yourself. The other is never\nresponsible. Remember that as a mantra: The other is never responsible....\nJust watch it ... just watch it. If you become wise in the moment, there will be no problem. This is\nwisdom that you get later on. Everybody becomes wise when the moment is gone. Retrospective\nwisdom is worthless. When you are picking on something, at that very moment become aware, and\nlet awareness function. Immediately you will drop it."
